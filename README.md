# CNS-rsaAlg
Develop a program to implement RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption. This
cryptosystem is one the initial system. It remains most employed cryptosystem even today. The
system was invented by three scholars Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman and hence, it is
termed as RSA cryptosystem. The two aspects of the RSA cryptosystem, firstly generation of key pair
and secondly encryption-decryption algorithms
